## Context
node js is awesome but kinda slow.  despite that, there is a bunch of ml stuff existing

probably more ML stuff is written in python.

## Decision

use node js where possible, but branch out when node js is too slow

## Consequences
### good
- known tools -> faster iteration time

### bad
- maybe future scaling issues
