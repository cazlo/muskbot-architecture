## Context
muskbot is the IP of me, Andrew Paettie.

the architecture is interesting and neat and something I can share with the world.

## Decision

Share architecture decisions about muskbot publicly.

Don't share anything publicly which could be used to attack the system.

Don't share specific details about the trade algorithms which differentiate muskbot from other trade bots. 

## Consequences
